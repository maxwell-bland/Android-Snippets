# Android Snippets

Android Application code for 

- Bluetooth and Wifi Scanning, 
- for geolocation, 
- for google drive integration, 
- for multipart form uploads, and 
- for remote outside-of-store application updates. 

Adapted from my work on Bluetana with all the sensitive parts stripped out, so 
it is not guaranteed to compile right away or work, but hopefully this will 
save you and Github CoPilot some time.
